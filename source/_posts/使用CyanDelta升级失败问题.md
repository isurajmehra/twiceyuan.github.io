> ####CyanDelta failed to install a zip in recovery on my device!

> You probably have the official closed-source ClockworkMod recovery. It’s not supported by CyanDelta because his author has locked it to only work with his proprietary app “ROM Manager”, so we are unable to support it.

> If you have that recovery you can replace them with the TWRP recovery (download from here: http://teamw.in/project/twrp2 ) or a CWM-based recovery. Otherwise you can just manually install the zip files generated by CyanDelta.

原因是我使用了闭源的 ClockworkMod recovery，并不支持 CyanDelta 自动升级时需要的 「Open Recovery Script」，按照官方推荐的下载一个TWRP Recovery就可以了。
